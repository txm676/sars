\usage{
\method{plot}{habitat}(
  x,
  IC = "AICc",
  type = 1,
  powFit = TRUE,
  lcol = NULL,
  pLeg = TRUE,
  legPos = "bottomright",
  legInset = 0,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'habitat'.}

\item{IC}{The information criterion weights to present (must
be one of 'AIC', 'BIC' or 'AICc'), if plotting a
\code{\link{sar_habitat}} object.}

\item{type}{Whether a Type 1 or Type 2 plot should be
generated, if plotting a \code{\link{sar_countryside}}
object (see details).}

\item{powFit}{For Type 1 plots, should the predicted total
richness values of the power (or logarithmic) model be
included as red points (logical argument).}

\item{lcol}{For Type 2 plots: the colours of the fitted lines,
for each component model. Should be a vector, the length
(and order) of which should match the number of species
groups in \code{x}. If not included, randomly selected
colours are used.}

\item{pLeg}{For Type 2 plots: should a legend be included
(logical argument), showing the line colours and
corresponding species groups.}

\item{legPos}{For Type 2 plots: the location of the legend.
Can either be a position (e.g., "bottomright"), or the x and
y co-ordinates to be used to position the legend (e.g.,
c(0,5)).}

\item{legInset}{For Type 2 plots: the inset argument in
  \code{\link[graphics]{legend}}. Enables the legend to be
  plotted outside the plotting window (it still needs the user
to manually change their graphical margin parameters).}

\item{\dots}{Further graphical parameters may be supplied as
arguments.}

\description{
S3 method for class 'habitat'.
  \code{plot.habitat} creates plots for objects of class
  habitat, using the R base plotting framework. The exact plot
  generated depends on whether the input data comes from
  \code{\link{sar_habitat}} or \code{\link{sar_countryside}}.
}
\details{
The exact plot that is generated depends on the input data. If 
 \code{x} is the fit object from \code{\link{sar_habitat}},
 a simple barplot of information criterion (IC) weights for the
 different model fits is produced. The particular IC metric to 
 use is chosen using the \code{IC} argument.
 
 If \code{x} is the fit object from
 \code{\link{sar_countryside}}, two plot types can be produced
 (selected using the \code{type} argument). A Type 1 plot
 plots the predicted total richness values (from both
 countryside and Arrhenius power (or logarithmic) SAR models)
 against the observed total richness values, with a regression
 line (intercept = 0, slope = 1) included to aid
 interpretation.
 
 A Type 2 plot uses \code{\link{countryside_extrap}}
 internally to generate separate fitted SAR curves for each of
 the modelled species groups, using a set of hypothetical
 sites (with area values ranging from the minimum to the
 maximum observed habitat area values across all sites) in
 which the proportion of the focal habitat relative to a
 specific species group (e.g., forest for forest species) is
 always 100 percent. For ubiquitous species, the mean number of
 species across each of the component models is calculated and
 used for plotting. See Matthews et al. (2025) for further
 details.
 
Note that the logarithmic SAR model doesn't work with zero
area values, so if any habitat area values are zero, the minimum 
area value of the 'hypothetical' sites used to generate the fitted
curves in a Type 2 plot is set to 0.01 if this model is used.
