\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'multi'.}

\item{type}{The type of plot to be constructed: either \code{type = multi}
for a plot of the multimodel SAR curve, or \code{type = bar} for a
barplot of the information criterion weights of each model.}

\item{allCurves}{A logical argument for use with \code{type = multi} that
specifies whether all the model fits should be plotted with the
multimodel SAR curve (\code{allCurves = TRUE}; the default) or that only
the multimodel SAR curve should be plotted (\code{allCurves = FALSE}).}

\item{xlab}{Title for the x-axis. Only for use with \code{type = multi}.}

\item{ylab}{Title for the y-axis.}

\item{pch}{Plotting character (for points). Only for use with \code{type =
multi}.}

\item{cex}{A numerical vector giving the amount by which plotting symbols
(points) should be scaled relative to the default.}

\item{pcol}{Colour of the points. Only for use with \code{type = multi}.}

\item{ModTitle}{Plot title (default is \code{ModTitle = NULL}, which
reverts to "Multimodel SAR" for \code{type = multi} and to "Model
weights" for \code{type = bar}). For no title, use \code{ModTitle = ""}.}

\item{TiAdj}{Which way the plot title is justified.}

\item{TiLine}{Places the plot title this many lines outwards from the plot
edge.}

\item{cex.main}{The amount by which the plot title should be scaled
relative to the default.}

\item{cex.lab}{The amount by which the axis titles should be scaled
relative to the default.}

\item{cex.axis}{The amount by which the axis labels should be scaled
relative to the default.}

\item{yRange}{The range of the y-axis. Only for use with \code{type = multi}.}

\item{lwd}{Line width. Only for use with \code{type = multi}.}

\item{lcol}{Line colour. Only for use with \code{type = multi}.}

\item{mmSep}{Logical argument of whether the multimodel curve should be
plotted as a separate line (default = FALSE) on top of the others, giving
the user more control over line width and colour. Only for use with
\code{type = multi} and \code{allCurves = TRUE}.}

\item{lwd.Sep}{If \code{mmSep = TRUE}, the line width of the multimodel
curve.}

\item{col.Sep}{If \code{mmSep = TRUE}, the colour of the multimodel curve.}

\item{pLeg}{Logical argument specifying whether or not the legend should be
plotted  (when \code{type = multi} and \code{allCurves = TRUE}).}

\item{modNames}{A vector of model names for the barplot of weights (when
\code{type = bar}). The default (\code{modNames = NULL}) uses abbreviated
versions (see below) of the names from the \code{sar_average} function.}

\item{cex.names}{The amount by which the axis labels (model names) should be
scaled relative to the default. Only for use with \code{type = bar}.}

\item{subset_weights}{Only create a barplot of the model weights for models
with a weight value above a given threshold (\code{subset_weights}). Only
for use with \code{type = bar}.}

\item{confInt}{A logical argument specifying whether confidence intervals
should be plotted around the multimodel curve. Can only be used if
confidence intervals have been generated in the \code{sar_average}
function.}

\item{\dots}{Further graphical parameters (see
\code{\link[graphics]{par}},
\code{\link[graphics]{plot.default}},\code{\link[graphics]{title}},
\code{\link[graphics]{lines}}) may be supplied as arguments.}

\description{
S3 method for class 'multi'. \code{plot.multi} creates plots
  for objects of class multi, using the R base plotting framework. Plots
  of all model fits, the multimodel SAR curve (with confidence intervals)
  and a barplot of the information criterion weights of the different
  models can be constructed.
}
\note{
In some versions of R and R studio, when plotting all model fits on the
  same plot with a legend it is necessary to manually extend your plotting
  window (height and width; e.g. the 'Plots' window of R studio) before
  plotting to ensure the legend fits in the plot. Extending the plotting
  window after plotting sometimes just stretches the legend.

  Occasionally a model fit will converge and pass the model fitting checks
  (e.g. residual normality) but the resulting fit is nonsensical (e.g. a
  horizontal line with intercept at zero). Thus, it can be useful to plot
  the resultant 'multi' object to check the individual model fits. To
  re-run the \code{sar_average} function without a particular model, simply
  remove it from the \code{obj} argument.

  For visual interpretation of the model weights barplot it is necessary
  to abbreviate the model names when plotting the weights of several
  models. To plot fewer bars, use the \code{subset_weights} argument to
  filter out models with lower weights than a threshold value. To provide
  a different set of names use the \code{modNames} argument. The model
  abbreviations used as the default are: \itemize{ 
  \item \strong{Pow} =   Power
  \item \strong{PowR} =   PowerR 
  \item \strong{E1} =   Extended_Power_model_1 
  \item \strong{E2} =   Extended_Power_model_2 
  \item \strong{P1} =   Persistence_function_1
  \item \strong{P2} =   Persistence_function_2 
  \item \strong{Loga} =   Logarithmic
  \item \strong{Kob} =   Kobayashi 
  \item \strong{MMF} =   MMF 
  \item \strong{Mon} =   Monod
  \item \strong{NegE} =   Negative_exponential 
  \item \strong{CR} =   Chapman_Richards
  \item \strong{CW3} =   Cumulative_Weibull_3_par. 
  \item \strong{AR} =  Asymptotic_regression 
  \item \strong{RF} =   Rational_function 
  \item \strong{Gom} =  Gompertz 
  \item \strong{CW4} =   Cumulative_Weibull_4_par. 
  \item \strong{BP} =  Beta-P_cumulative 
  \item \strong{Logi} =   Logistic(Standard)
  \item \strong{Hel} =   Heleg(Logistic) 
  \item \strong{Lin} =   Linear_model}
