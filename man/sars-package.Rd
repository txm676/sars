\title{sars: Fit and compare species-area relationship models using multimodel inference}
\description{
This package provides functions to fit twenty models to
  species-area relationship (SAR) data (see Triantis et al. 2012), plot the
  model fits, and to construct a multimodel SAR curve using information
  criterion weights. A number of additional SAR functions are provided, e.g.
  to fit the log-log power model, the general dynamic model of island
  biogeography (GDM), Coleman's Random Placement model, and piecewise ISAR
  models (i.e. models with thresholds in the ISAR).
}
\details{
Functions are provided to fit 20 individual SAR models. Nineteen are
  fitted using non-linear regression, whilst a single model (the linear
  model) is fitted using linear regression. Each model has its own function
  (e.g. \code{\link{sar_power}}). A set of multiple model fits can be
  combined into a fit collection (\code{\link{sar_multi}}). Plotting
  functions (\code{\link{plot.sars}}) are provided that enable individual
  model fits to be plotted on their own, or the fits of multiple models to be
  overlayed on the same plot. Model fits can be validated using a number of
  checks, e.g. the normality and homogeneity of the model residuals can be
  assessed.

  A multimodel SAR curve can be constructed using the
  \code{\link{sar_average}} function. This fits up to twenty SAR models and
  constructs the multimodel curve (with confidence intervals) using
  information criterion weights (see \code{\link{summary.sars}} to calculate
  a table of models ranked by information criterion weight). The
  \code{\link{plot.multi}} functions enables the multimodel SAR curve to be
  plotted with or without the fits of the individual models.

  Other SAR related functions include: (i) \code{\link{lin_pow}}, which fits
  the log-log power model and enables comparison of the model parameters with
  those calculated using the non-linear power model, (ii) \code{\link{gdm}},
  which fits the general dynamic model of island biogeography (Whittaker et
  al. 2008) using several different functions, and (iii)
  \code{\link{coleman}}, which fits Coleman's  (1981) random placement model
  to a species-site abundance matrix. Version 1.3.0 has added functions for
  fitting, evaluating and plotting a range of commonly used piecewise SAR
  models (\code{\link{sar_threshold}}).

\examples{
data(galap, package = "sars")
#fit the power model
fit <- sar_power(galap)
summary(fit)
plot(fit)

#Construct a multimodel averaged SAR curve, using no grid_start simply
#for speed (not recommended - see documentation for sar_average())
fit_multi <- sar_average(data = galap, grid_start = "none")
summary(fit_multi)
plot(fit_multi)
