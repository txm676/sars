##This is a re-submission
*version 2.0.0 of sars package
*I have fixed the pdf-latex issue and the PDF manual builds
without errors now
*R CMD check throws one note about not accessing the correct time 
but this seems to be due to a broken url in the checks

##Test environments

*Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (64-bit), R 4.4.1 (via Circle CI)
