##This is a new submission
*version 2.0.0 of sars package
*I have updated the tests as the package was flagged
by new CRAN checks
*1 note is generated by the R CMD check but this relates to
being unable to verify time stamps (seemingly related to a broken
URL)

##Test environments

*Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (64-bit), R 4.4.1 (via Circle CI)
