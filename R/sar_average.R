#' @param display Show the model fitting output and related messages.
#'  (default: \code{display == TRUE}).
#' @details The multimodel SAR curve is constructed using information criterion
#'   weights (see Burnham & Anderson, 2002; Guilhaumon et al. 2010). If
#'   \code{obj} is a vector of n model names the function fits the n models to
#'   the dataset provided using the \code{sar_multi} function. A dataset must
#'   have four or more datapoints to fit the multimodel curve. If any models
#'   cannot be fitted they are removed from the multimodel SAR. If \code{obj} is
#'   a fit_collection object (created using the \code{sar_multi} function), any
#'   model fits in the collection which are NA are removed. In addition, if any
#'   other model checks have been selected (i.e. residual normality and
#'   heterogeneity tests, and checks for negative predicted richness values),
#'   these are undertaken and any model that fails the selected test(s) is
#'   removed from the multimodel SAR. The order of the additional checks inside
#'   the function is (if all are turned on): normality of residuals, homogeneity
#'   of residuals, and a check for negative fitted values. Once a model fails
#'   one test it is removed and thus is not available for further tests. Thus, a
#'   model may fail multiple tests but the returned warning will only provide
#'   information on a single test. We have now changed the defaults so that
#'   no checks are undertaken, so it is up to the user to select any checks if
#'   appropriate.
#'
#'   The resultant models are then used to construct the multimodel SAR curve.
#'   For each model in turn, the model fitted values are multiplied by the
#'   information criterion weight of that model, and the resultant values are
#'   summed across all models (Burnham & Anderson, 2002). Confidence intervals
#'   can be calculated (using \code{confInt}) around the multimodel averaged
#'   curve using the bootstrap procedure outlined in Guilhaumon et al (2010).The
#'   procedure transforms the residuals from the individual model fits and
#'   occasionally NAs / Inf values can be produced - in these cases, the model
#'   is removed from the confidence interval calculation (but not the multimodel
#'   curve itself). There is also a constraint within the procedure to remove
#'   any transformed residuals that result in negative richness values. When
#'   several SAR models are used, when grid_start is turned on and when the
#'   number of bootstraps (\code{ciN}) is large, generating the confidence
#'   intervals can take a (very) long time. Parallel processing will be added to
#'   future versions.
#'   
#'   Choosing starting parameter values for non-linear regression optimisation
#'   algorithms is not always straight forward, depending on the data at hand.
#'   In the package, we use various approaches to choose default starting
#'   parameters. However, we also use a grid search process which creates a
#'   large array of different possible starting parameter values (within certain
#'   bounds) and then randomly selects a proportion of these to test. There are
#'   three options for the \code{grid_start} argument to control this process.
#'   The default (\code{grid_start = "partial"}) randomly samples 500 different
#'   sets of starting parameter values for each model, adds these to the model's
#'   default starting values and tests all of these. A more comprehensive set of
#'   starting parameter estimates can be used (\code{grid_start = "exhaustive"})
#'   - this option allows the user to choose the number of starting parameter
#'   sets to be tested (using the \code{grid_n} argument) and includes a range
#'   of additional starting parameter estimates, e.g. very small values and
#'   particular values we have found to be useful for individual models. Using
#'   \code{grid_start = "exhaustive"} in combination with a large \code{grid_n}
#'   can be very time consuming; however, we would recommend it as it makes it
#'   more likely that the optimal model fit will be found, particularly for the
#'   more complex models. This is particularly true if any of the model fits
#'   does not converge, returns a singular gradient at parameter estimates, or
#'   the plot of the model fit does not look optimum. The grid start procedure
#'   can also be turned off (\code{grid_start = "none"}), meaning just the
#'   default starting parameter estimates are used. Note that \code{grid_start}
#'   has been disabled for a small number of models (e.g. Weibull 3 par.). See
#'   the vignette for more information. Remember that, as grid_start has a
#'   random component, when \code{grid_start != "none"}, you can get slightly
#'   different results each time you fit a model or run \code{sar_average}.
#'   
#'   Even with grid_start, occasionally a model fit will be able to be fitted
#'   and pass the model fitting checks (e.g. residual normality) but the
#'   resulting fit is nonsensical (e.g. a horizontal line with intercept at
#'   zero). Thus, it can be useful to plot the resultant 'multi' object to check
#'   the individual model fits. To re-run the \code{sar_average} function
#'   without a particular model, simply remove it from the \code{obj} argument.
#'   
#'   The \code{sar_models()} function can be used to bring up a list of the 20
#'   model names. \code{display_sars_models()} generates a table of the 20
#'   models with model information.
#'
#' @return If no models have been successfully fitted and passed the model
#'   checks, an error is returned. If only a single model is successfully
#'   fitted, this individual model fit object (of class 'sars') is returned,
#'   given no model averaging can be undertaken. If more than two models have
#'   been successfully fitted and passed the model checks, a list of class
#'   "multi" and class "sars" with two elements. The first element ('mmi')
#'   contains the fitted values of the multimodel sar curve. The second element
#'   ('details') is a list with the following components:
#'   \itemize{ 
#'    \item \strong{mod_names}   Names of the models that were successfully
#'   fitted and passed any model check 
#'   \item \strong{fits}   A fit_collection object containing the successful model fits 
#'   \item \strong{ic}   The information criterion selected 
#'   \item \strong{norm_test}   The residual normality test selected
#'   \item \strong{homo_test}   The residual homogeneity test selected
#'   \item \strong{alpha_norm_test}   The alpha value used in the residual normality test 
#'   \item \strong{alpha_homo_test}  The alpha value used in the residual homogeneity test 
#'   \item \strong{ics}   The information criterion values (e.g. AIC values) of the model fits 
#'   \item \strong{delta_ics}   The delta information criterion values

#'   \item \strong{no_fit}   Names of the models which could not be fitted or did not pass model checks
#'   \item \strong{convergence}   Logical value indicating whether \code{\link{optim}}
#'   model convergence code = 0, for each model}
#'   
#'   The \code{\link{summary.sars}} function returns a more useful summary of
#'   the model fit results, and the \code{\link{plot.multi}} plots the
#'   multimodel curve.
#' @note There are different types of non-convergence and these are dealt with
#'   differently in the package. If the optimisation algorithm fails to return
#'   any solution, the model fit is defined as NA and is then removed, and so
#'   does not appear in the model summary table or multi-model curve etc.
#'   However, the optimisation algorithm (e.g. Nelder-Mead) can also return
#'   non-NA model fits but where the solution is potentially non-optimal (e.g.
#'   degeneracy of the Nelder–Mead simplex) - these cases are identified by any
#'   \code{\link{optim}} convergence code that is not zero. We have decided not
#'   to remove these fits (i.e. they are kept in the model summary table and
#'   multimodel curve) - as arguably a non-optimal fit is still better than no
#'   fit - but any instances can be checked using the returned
#'   \code{details$converged} vector and then the model fitting re-run without
#'   these models, if preferred. Increasing the starting parameters grid search
#'   (see above) may also help avoid this issue.
#'
#'   The generation of confidence intervals around the multimodel curve (using
#'   \code{confInt == TRUE}), may throw up errors that we have yet to come
#'   across. Please report any issues to the package maintainer.
#'   
#'   There are different formulas for calculating the various information
#'   criteria (IC) used for model comparison (e.g. AIC, BIC). For example, some
#'   formulas use the residual sum of squares (rss) and others the
#'   log-likelihood (ll). Both are valid approaches and will give the same
#'   parameter estimates, but it is important to only compare IC values that
#'   have been calculated using the same approach. For example, the 'sars'
#'   package used to use formulas based on the rss, while the \link[stats]{nls}
#'   function function in the stats package uses formulas based on the ll. To
#'   increase the compatibility between nls and sars, we have changed our
#'   formulas such that now our IC formulas are the same as those used in the
#'   \link[stats]{nls} function. See the "On the calculation of information
#'   criteria" section in the package vignette for more information.
#'
#'   The mmf model was found to be equivalent to the He & Legendre logistic, and
#'   so the former has been deprecated (as of Feb 2021). We have removed it from
#'   the default models in \code{sar_average}, although it is still available to
#'   be used for the time being (using the \code{obj} argument). The standard
#'   logistic model has been added in its place, and is now used as default
#'   within \code{sar_average}.

#' Use SAR model fits to predict richness on islands of a given size
#'
#' @description Predict the richness on an island of a given size using either
#'   individual SAR model fits, a fit_collection of model fits, or a multi-model
#'   SAR curve.
#' @usage sar_pred(fit, area)
#' @param fit Either a model fit object, a fit_collection object (generated
#'   using \code{\link{sar_multi}}), or a sar_multi object (generated using
#'   \code{\link{sar_average}}).
#' @param area A numeric vector of area values (length >= 1).
#' @details Extrapolation (e.g. predicting the richness of areas too large to be
#'   sampled) is one of the primary uses of the SAR. The \code{sar_pred}
#'   function provides an easy method for undertaking such an exercise. The
#'   function works by taking an already fitted SAR model, extacting the
#'   parameter values and then using these values and the model function to
#'   predict the richness for any value of area provided.
#'
#'   If a multi-model SAR curve is used for prediction (i.e. using
#'   \code{\link{sar_average}}), the model information criterion weight (i.e.
#'   the conditional probabilities for each of the n models) for each of the
#'   individual model fits that were used to generate the curve are stored. The
#'   n models are then each used to predict the richness of a larger area and
#'   these predictions are multiplied by the respective model weights and summed
#'   to provide a multi-model averaged prediction.
#'
#' @return A data.frame of class 'sars' with three columns: 1) the name of the
#'   model, 2) the area value for which a prediction has been generated, and 3)
#'   the prediction from the model extrapolation.
#' @note This function is used in the ISAR extrapolation paper of Matthews &
#'   Aspin (2019).
#'
#'   Code to calculate confidence intervals around the predictions using
#'   bootstrapping will be added in a later version of the package.
#'
#'   As grid_start has a random component, when \code{grid_start != "none"} in
#'   your model fitting, you can get slightly different results each time you
#'   fit a model or run \code{sar_average} and then run \code{sar_pred} on it.
#'   We would recommend using \code{grid_start = "exhaustive"} as this is more
#'   likely to find the optimum fit for a given model.
#' @references Matthews, T.J. & Aspin, T.W.H. (2019) Model averaging fails to
